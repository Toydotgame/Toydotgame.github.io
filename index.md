# Toydotgam's Website

I am a software developer on the Gold Coast, in Australia. I am also the co-founder and CEO of [scratltd](https://scratltd.github.io/). I enjoy making projects in Java (which I am learning) and Batch, and I usually just mess around on the command-line.

I made this little site to showcase applications and projects I'm currently making or have completed, along with updates on these too.
