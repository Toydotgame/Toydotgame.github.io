# Welcome
Hi, I'm toydotgame.

I'm a software developer who specialises in Java applications; my current work includes developing and maintaining Spigot plugins, alongside the development of other things – mostly just small desktop applications. I have also worked with a bit of C# (for game dev) and JS (I maintain a Firefox addon). [Find out a bit more about what I've done here.](pages/about.html)

* Not much really.

## Projects
### [Old Google](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/old-google/)
<img src="assets/images/old-google.png" width="75" id="inline" /> This is a simple Firefox addon that replaces the current Google logo on google.com and the search page to use the old 2010 – 2013 logo.

### [Thisway](https://spigotmc.org/resources/thisway.87115/)
<img src="assets/images/Thisway_Rounded.png" width="75" id="inline" /> Thisway is a Spigot plugin for 1.6 and up which implements a simpler teleportation system based off of local distances. (e.g: _Go this way 75 blocks_)
<br><br>
### [SinglePlayerSleep](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/singleplayersleep.91195/)
<img src="assets/images/Bed.png" width="75" id="inline" /> SinglePlayerSleep is a visual copy of Hermitcraft's single player sleep plugin. It allows a player to skip the world's time to day when only they are sleeping in a Bed, rather than needing everyone online to be in bed.
