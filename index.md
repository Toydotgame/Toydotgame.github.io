# Welcome!
### Welcome to my little website on a corner of the internet, enjoy your stay.

I am a software developer on the Gold Coast, in Australia. I am the co-founder and CEO of [TSL](https://scratltd.github.io/). I enjoy making projects in Java (which I am learning), HTML, JavaScript, BASIC, Python, and VBScript.

I made this little site to showcase applications and projects I'm currently making or have completed, along with updates on these too.
