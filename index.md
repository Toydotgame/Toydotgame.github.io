# Welcome
Hi, I'm toydotgame.

I'm currently developer and maintainer of a few Spigot plugins. I know Java, and I've worked with a bit of C#, JS, PHP, and your basic HTML and CSS static web dev. [Find out a bit more about what I've done here.](pages/about.html)

## You may Know me For

* Not much to show here. I've never really done anything that major.

## Projects
### [Old Google](https://github.com/toydotgame/old-google)
This is a simple Firefox addon that replaces the current Google logo on google.com and the search page to use the old 2010 â€“ 2013 logo.

### [Thisway](https://spigotmc.org/resources/thisway.87115/)
<img src="assets/images/Thisway_Rounded.png" width="75" id="inline" /> Thisway is a Spigot plugin for 1.6 and up which enables a bit of a simpler teleportation system for going in a certain direction.

### [SinglePlayerSleep](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/singleplayersleep.91195/) & [SleepMessage](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/sleepmessage.91191/)
<img src="assets/images/Bed.png" width="75" id="inline" /> SinglePlayerSleep is a visual copy of Hermitcraft's single player sleep plugin. It allows a player to skip the world's time to day when only they are sleeping in a Bed, rather than needing everyone online to be in bed.
