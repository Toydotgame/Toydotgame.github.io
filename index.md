# Toydotgam's Website

## Welcome to my little website on a corner of the internet, enjoy your stay.

I am a software developer on the Gold Coast, in Australia. I am also the co-founder and CEO of [TSL](https://scratltd.github.io/). I enjoy making projects in Java (which I am learning), HTML, JavaScript, BASIC, Python, and VBScript.

I made this little site to showcase applications and projects I'm currently making or have completed, along with updates on these too.

## TSL
I founded TSL under the name `The Scratchers Ltd.` in March of 2017 by myself as I had gained an interest in computers and coding the previous year and set off on _Scratch_ (yes, I know), to follow my dream of making cool new applications. Inevitably, in mid-2017, I moved on from Scratch, realising it wan't the best path to follow; I found it less and less _code_ like every as every minute of the day passed, so I left the site. (You can still find [my profile](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Toydotgam/) there to this day anyhow)

I went on to learn HTML and CSS, and after a week produced [this eyesore](https://thescratchersltd.github.io/home.html) (I _still_ used that page until late **2019**). I hosted the page on GitHub Pages after making my first GitHub account, which I used 'till early 2020, ([this is it](https://github.com/Toydotgam/)). On the last day of 2019, I completely redesigned the company's website, and renamed it to `TSL.`, to further myself even more from Scratch, and focusing on web development as a company. I still personally venture to create desktop applications and simple applications in languages like Java, actually; mainly Java. The TSL website is still up on the same design at [scratltd.github.io](https://scratltd.github.io/), but now with more content.

The TSL team is two strong, and will stay as a very small buisness as it is more of a friends' shared hobby project rather than a real attempt of stable income.

### A \[lot of\] Text
#### Scratch
In 2016 I discovered the wonderful world of coding, due to stumbling across a website called _Scratch_, where you could make cool games my snapping together functions like LEGO. I stayed interested in Scratch 'till 2017, where I would discover how to make a website with HTML and CSS.

#### HTML (And CSS)
My first website was made in HTML alongside a CSS stylesheet with the world prize for sloppiest code organisation. It was done with the help of a book which had a little _too much_ want for style, and thus made me make [the most eye-destroying abomination to ever roam the earth](https://thescratchersltd.github.io/home.html). I - suprisingly - used this website layout until _2019_. On December 31<sup>st</sup>, 2019; I would re-make the TSL website to the design it uses today (committed on January 1<sup>st</sup>, as _[Update 4.0.0](https://github.com/scratltd/scratltd.github.io/commit/06fc72ed43be222dbd5ea99e059479e94acd0529)_; the site is still on the Update 4 structure, and as I write this, is on update [4.6.4](https://github.com/scratltd/scratltd.github.io/commit/99a62936bc77fad5de2620d295617c2c1c1c0059)), with a nice navigation bar from _W3 Schools_, tweaked to the width I wanted; a tutorial on the internet for CSS helped me make the style for the main content section and the footer; the rest (background, image positioning) was fiddled with my me. I find the website's design is dated, but in the good way which just _works_ and still holds up to this day, very well. (It definitely does better than someone's crappy 1997 GeoCities job! (I'm looking at you; 2017-19 _professional HTML rubbish maker_ me...))

#### Scripts (Of the Java and Visual Basic kind)
In 2018 I learned how to make a `MsgBox` command in Notepad, and enjoyed creating little storylines with choices and such, I would develop more skill with VBScript by searching up how to do _this_ or _that_ with VBS and make my stories more intricate, I never - and still to this day - made (or will be making) any proper useful or powerfull applications with it.
In _2019_, I learnt to make little `alert()` popups with JavaScript to put in my websites, and I use JavaScript to make such popups on my websites, such as the TSL staff logon, it's made using JavaScript.

#### Python
I never made anything big with Python, nor learned much with it, but I still know the _very_ basics and quite rearely play around with it.

#### Java
I decided to learn Java last month (June 2020) because I was feeling bored, I downloaded an IDE (I chose Eclipse), and followed an online tutorial on how to do it, it went well, and after a while I ventured further. I'm now learning on how to make GUIs and such with a simple button-based idle game I'm making for fun. ~~And also to spite my friend who did the same thing earlier in Scratch; and well, Scratch is, well, _Scratch_; so I decided to make the same thing as a standalone Java spplication.~~
