# Welcome
Hi, I'm toydotgame.
I'm currently developer and maintainer of a few Spigot plugins. I know Java; I'm learning C#; and I've done small amounts of static web-dev. [Find out a bit more about what I've done here.](about.html)

## Projects
### [Thisway](https://spigotmc.org/resources/thisway.87115/)
* <img src="assets/images/Thisway_Rounded.png" width="96" display="inline" /> Thisway is a Spigot plugin for 1.6 and up which enables a bit of a simpler teleportation system for going in a certain direction.
