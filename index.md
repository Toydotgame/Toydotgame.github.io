# Toydotgam's Website

## Welcome to my little website on a corner of the internet, enjoy your stay.

I am a software developer on the Gold Coast, in Australia. I am also the co-founder and CEO of [TSL](https://scratltd.github.io/). I enjoy making projects in Java (which I am learning), HTML, Batch, and maybe C++.

I made this little site to showcase applications and projects I'm currently making or have completed, along with updates on these too.
