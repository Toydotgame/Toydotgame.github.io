# Toydotgam's Website

I am a software developer who doesn't really know what they're doing. I was also the co-founder of [scratltd](https://scratltd.github.io/), a now-defunct company. I enjoy making projects in Java (which I am learning, slowly) and Batch, and I usually just mess around on the command-line.

I made this little site to showcase applications and projects I'm currently making or have completed, along with updates on these too.
