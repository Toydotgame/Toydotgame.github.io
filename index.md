# Welcome
Hi, I'm toydotgame.

I'm currently developer and maintainer of a few Spigot plugins. I know Java; I'm learning C#; and I've done small amounts of static web-dev. [Find out a bit more about what I've done here.](about.html)

## Projects
### [Thisway](https://spigotmc.org/resources/thisway.87115/)
<img src="assets/images/Thisway_Rounded.png" width="75" id="inline" /> Thisway is a Spigot plugin for 1.6 and up which enables a bit of a simpler teleportation system for going in a certain direction.
<br><br>
### [SinglePlayerSleep](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/singleplayersleep.91195/) & [SleepMessage](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/sleepmessage.91191/)
<img src="assets/images/Bed.png" width="75" id="inline" /> SinglePlayerSleep is a visual copy of Hermitcraft's singple player sleep plugin. It allows a player to skip the world's time to day when only they are sleeping in a Bed, rather than needing everyone online to be in a Bed.

SleepMessage is a visual copy of Legacy Console Edition Minecraft's chat messages when someone gets into a Bed.
<br>
### [ToyPack](https://github.com/toydotgame/ToyPack/)
<img src="assets/images/pack.png" width="75" id="inline" style="border-radius:10%" /> ToyPack is a texture pack designed for Minecraft 1.6.4 (the version I play on), which features texture modifications that I prefer. It has a large feature list, and it's something that I actually have a need to continually work on.

Check it out, if you'd like. It may be for you, or it may not.

### [b43-firmware, Offline Edition](https://github.com/toydotgame/b43-firmware/)
This one is just me doing my best to make a certain AUR package offline, for convenience. (Just in case thye AUR 404s the main one, too!)
My laptop has a B43-series WiFi card, so I need the driver. This was the main reason I couldn't install Arch Linux. I keep it because it's vital for my system; and just in case anything goes wrong.
<br>
### My `~/.dotfiles/` Repo.
This one is on GitHub, but closed-source - because it contains access keys and hashes, etc.

I'm proud of it because of its `install.sh` file. It's quite nice, as it does everything, hands free. (If you run it as `sudo ./install.sh`, that is)
<br>
### [Cat & Search New Tab](https://github.com/cat-of-the-day-newtab)
Some time in 2020, I found a site called [catoftheday.com](http://catoftheday.com/). [My cat even got on there!](http://catoftheday.com/archive/2020/March/18.html)
I ended up making a simple website which hosted search bars for different search engines (including [Google](https://github.com/cat-of-the-day-newtab/google/), [Bing](https://github.com/cat-of-the-day-newtab/bing/), [DuckDuckGo](https://github.com/cat-of-the-day-newtab/duckduckgo/), and [Ask.com](https://github.com/cat-of-the-day-newtab/askjeeves)), with an iframe of the CotD website.
