# About Me
## What I Do
Not much. I play Minecraft and Animal Crossing (the GameCube version because I'm cool like that), I code when I can actually come up with ideas, and I talk to friends.

This site is mostly dedicated to my code-related doings, however.

## What I've Done in the Past
### 2016
* [A pretty awful Scratch account.](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Minecraft-Game/) This is how I discovered software development. Yep.

### 2017
* [More Scratch.](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Toydotgam/)
* Around this time, I got in to Windows (around build 1709 if you're interested) and computer hardware.
* I made my first website, and trust me, it looked like it was straight out of the '90s. No, you can't see it.

### 2018
* Nothing much, more Scratch, and more static web dev.

### 2019
* In 2019, I started distro hopping, from Kubuntu, to Ubuntu, to Majaro, back to Ubuntu, and then I found Archâ€¦

### 2020
* In 2020, I got a Dell Inspiron 1545 (from like 2009 or 2010 or something) with 3 GBs of RAM and an awful CPU. This was also my first personal computer that only I used.
* In February, I started my Minecraft server, ICCMC. It started out being hosted on my "new" laptop, but as of early 2021 it has its own dedicated PC (an old Lenovo ThinkCentre).
* From early-mid-2020, I started learning Java.
* This website was launched sometime in the middle of the year.
* In November, I may or may not have accidentally wiped the parition table of my hard drive. I bought an SSD to replace it, which was a blessing on such an old laptop; and, as I was without any data and had nothing to lose, I might as well try Arch, right? Yeah, I still use Arch to this day and I'm never going back. So long, Windows 7.
* In December I wrote the concept and base code for my first major Java project that I intended to support for a long time, Thisway. I still support and develop that plugin to this day.

### 2021
* I upgraded my crappy laptop to its max specs, 8 GBs of RAM, the aforementioned SSD, and a decent Core 2 Duo.
* In July I rewrote my personal website to what it is today.
* In October, I started [my first ever browser extension](https://github.com/toydotgame/old-google)! It's a Firefox addon that achieved the fairly simple goal of changing the Google logo on google.com. Like Thisway, I still plan, and _do_, support this addon to this day.

### 2022
* I built a new PC. [Specs here.](https://pcpartpicker.com/b/PTskcf) It's a massive upgrade from what I came from.
