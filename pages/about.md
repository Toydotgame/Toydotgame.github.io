# About Me

## A Timeline, Year by Year
### 2016
In 2016, I discovered Scratch. I made Scratch things. [They weren't good.](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Minecraft-Game/)

### 2017
By 2017, I made [another Scratch account](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Toydotgam/). I made more Scratch things. They also sucked, but a bit less this time.

I also became a Windows Insider and got my hands on the cool new features of Windows 10, build 1709. This marks the point where I really became interested in computing.

By late 2017, I got a HTML book. I made a terrible, terrible CSS stylesheet for a test website.

With my bad website, I made a company for it - and other projects I was going to plan: _The Scractchers Ltd._

### 2018
I played more with my HTML and CSS, and tweaked my terrible stylesheet to my liking. But, for most of 2018, I played with the Windows 10 updates 1803 and 1809. 

### 2019
In 2019, I brought my bad 2017 website to GitHub, via GitHub Pages. By December, I rebranded The Scratchers Ltd. to _TSL._

2019 was also the year I started my Linux shenanigans. I did a bit of distro-hopping with Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Manjaro, and Kubuntu.

### 2020
I got a new computer in 2020. By "new," I mean "nearly a decade old." It was a Dell Inspiron 1545 with 3 GBs of RAM, a 400 GB HDD, and a Pentium T4400. It also had Windows 7.

In February, I started my Minecraft server. I originally hosted it on the same laptop as I did everything else on.

2020 was the year I decided to learn Java. By mid-2020, I had made a few basic desktop applications.

A bit later, I made this website. Originally with a default GitHub Pages theme, and bad.

In November, I may or may not have "accidentally" wiped the parition table of my hard drive. I bought an SSD to replace it anyway. I did lose a lot of data, which I'll try recovering one day. With no Windows left, I found an old backup drive, wiped it, and installed Arch Linux on it.

By December, I decided to try making Spigot plugins. My first two concepts failed to port to Spigot well, but then I eventually sat down one day and made a Spigot plugin: Thisway. This one worked; which was a first.

### 2021
I upgraded my computer to what it has today. 8 GBs of RAM, an Intel Core 2 Duo T9900, a WD Blue SSD (1 TB) and Arch (now as my main OS).

I also bought a lenovo ThinkCentre for my Minecraft server.

In 2021, I had to make a few Unity games in C# for a project. C# isn't as bad as I thought.

In July I rewrote my personal website. Now it's not half-bad!

## What do I do on the internet?
Aside from developing Spigot plugins, I play Minecraft on my Minecraft server (where I've done quite a few things), I use Twitter (a bit), and I frequent the Minecraft Forums. That's about it.
