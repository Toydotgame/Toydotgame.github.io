## Personal Projects (Mainly Java)
### Elevator
#### [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Toydotgame/elevator)
This plugin is a simple elevator for Spigot 1.6.4, as no other plugin for 1.6.4 exists with this funtionality. Still in development.
Works with the command `/up <height>`, and teleports you up that many blocks on top of a glass block.

### Clicker Clicker
#### (Being remade)
#### [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Toydotgame/ClickerClicker)
This is a project by me as a Java recreation of a similar Scratch game made by a friend. I don't know if the final game will have the same point as the original.
I've got a school project which requires a game and there is **_no way in hell_** that I'm doing in _Code.org_.
##### Java works far better with me than half-broken JavaScript.

### Batch File Generator
#### [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Toydotgame/batFileGenerator)
This is a simple one-line `.bat` file creator (which also adds a `pause` statement at the end). I made it because a friend's Command Prompt wouldn't work but batch files _did_; so I made this quick creator for her.
