# Projects
## Mainly Java Applications

### HTML E-Mail Creator
#### [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Toydotgame/emailHTMLGenerator)
This program makes a HTML birthday card with the information you provide in the GUI. It was made for a school project I am over-doing.
Expect to see updates as I tweak the HTML output to better match the assessment criterion.

### Clicker Clicker
#### (Discontinued)
#### [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Toydotgame/ClickerClicker)
This is a \[discontinued\] project by me as a Java recreation of a similar Scratch game made by a friend. I stopped development as the application was created badly and what I wanted to do was made impossible. Also, [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62480554/whats-a-simple-way-to-slow-down-a-loop) is [_crappy_ to me](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62727185/how-can-i-make-a-slow-loop).

### Batch File Generator
#### [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Toydotgame/batFileGenerator)
This is a simple one-line `.bat` file creator (which also adds a `pause` statement at the end). I made it because a friend's Command Prompt wouldn't work but batch files _did_; so I made this quick creator for her.

#### This is about all of my recent development (mainly in Java). One day there'll be more here.
