			<h1>Welcome!</h1>
			<p><a href="https://en.pronouns.page/@toydotgame" title="My Pronouns" target="_blank">Hi, I'm toydotgame.</a> I'm a software developer who specialises in Java (with experience in others too), and I'm also somewhat active online in the Technical Minecraft (TMC), furry, and iPod communities. I run the <a href="https://iccmc.toydotgame.net/">ICCMC Minecraft Server</a> between me and my friends. This site and the ICCMC page serve as my web development handiwork; it's not my strong suit but I like to play with it from time to time.</p>

			<p>Welcome to my corner of the internet! This site's been rewritten a few times now (read about that more <a href="/blog/2023-12-16_v5">here</a>, or check out my <a href="/blog/">blog!</a>). Enjoy your stay!</p>
			<p>If you're looking on where to find me, you can find my socials back on the <a href="/">main page</a>. It's the most comprehensive list of what platforms I'm on currently. Of course, I go by "toydotgame" on just about all of my accounts I've had for years now â€“ so chances are that you can find me under "toydotgame" on any site you're looking for specifically.</p>
