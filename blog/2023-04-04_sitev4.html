			<h1>This site gets rewritten for the 4th time!</h1>
			<p>Yeah. This is the fourth time I've done this. To be fair, the first edition of my site was in 2017 and was based off of my first ever "Hello, world!" page in HTML; obviously, it was bad.</p>
			<p>Rewrites 2 and 3 used GitHub Pages' Jekyll static site generator. They actually weren't that bad, web-design speaking, but I've rewritten the site again using my own code because I think it's just better. No frameworks, therefore no bloat, right? (I do apologise as this idea sounds pretty weak given that my CSS code I've just finished writing now for this page is uh…not the greatest. (I just discovered the <code>calc()</code> function in CSS))</p>
			<br>
			<p>The thing that actually triggered me to do this rewrite was beause I wanted one of those Carrd sites with the socials links and stuff, as I had just finished making my <a href="https://en.pronouns.page/@toydotgame">pronouns.page</a>. But, I didn't like the certainty that a Carrd site 1. wouldn't be as customisable as hardcoded HTML/CSS, and 2. would probably have tons of JS and HTML bloat. I then looked at my own site, which used Jekyll and so was a victim of the exact same issue… (Maybe to a lesser extent but my point still stands)</p> <!-- write about carrd and links and css for that page specifically and the new site how it is and include images of the landing page and the home page (which u still gotta do) and some ur old sites too AND port old articles across ty -->
