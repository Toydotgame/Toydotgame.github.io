			<h1>The History of my names Online and Where "toydotgame" came From</h1>
			<h2 id="subtitle">Written: <b>2023-04-05</b> &centerdot; Last Updated: <b>2023-08-12</b></h2>
			<h2>Pre-toydotgame</h2>
			<p>My oldest username I came up with was in 2014. It was "SCRIBBELS" – I thought it was a funny word; and, as I'm sure you've already noticed, it's spelt incorrectly. This was unintentional. I really just didn't know how to spell. I used that name for about two and a half years, finally with it falling out of use sometime in 2016 where I just kinda forgot it existed.</p>
			<small>The only proof that this account exists is a 2014 or 2015 (I don't remember exactly) registered account on <a href="https://jninteractive.com/projects/">JNInteractive's now abandoned service "Seeds Pro" for Minecraft</a>, which I used to use. (JNInteractive itself seems to be an entirely abandoned company now, unfortunately, with their last social media update on Twitter being in 2016) The service is read-only, so at least you can still <i>see</i> "SCRIBBELS" there. This then would be the oldest account of mine, ever, that is known to exist.</small>
			<p>In 2016, I started a YouTube channel (which is lost to time and I would <b>love</b> to find it again – but that's a story for another day) called "The Great Fireball36863" – yet another amazing name. I still have a Skype account with this name as well. I don't remember this name all too much other than that I had it.</p>
			<p>Another name I had in 2016 was on my first Mojang account, <a href="https://namemc.com/profile/DJPlasma900.1">DJPlasma900</a>. I still use this account as my main Minecraft account to this day, and so its name history forever holds a ghost of my pre-toydotgame past lol. It's nice to still actively use such an old account today, but also DJPlasma900 was a <i>terrible</i> name. I think all of my pre-toydotgame names are pretty terrible because they all are either un-unique or have numbers in them (ew).</p>
			<p>The third and final name I came up with in 2016 was the name for my Scratch account: "Minecraft-Game." <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/minecraft-game/">Minecraft-Game on Scratch</a> is currently the oldest account I still have access to today, being created on March 14<sup>th</sup>, 2016. I think this username was also only used on Scratch and nowhere else.</p>
			<h2>2017</h2>
			<p>In 2017, I came up with the username "Toydotgam." It was brilliant: one word, easy to pronounce, no numbers, and it had <i>never</i> been used online before me. When I came up with it, I initially planned to have my handle (on sites like Twitter) as <code>@Toydotgame</code>, with the display name "Toydotgam," although this never properly happened.</p>
			<h3><i>Right, so how did you even come up with it though?</i></h3>
			<p>Well I should probably preface this with the following: I was a massive Logdotzip fan at the time. It was the dark age of MCYT from 2015 – 2018, so don't judge! Lol. Anyway, I would spend hours a day binging his content for months at a time in 2017. So, when I decided to start thinking up a name, I wanted it to be "inspired" or just straight-up based off of his name.</p>
			<p>"Logdotzip" had three syllables, and so did "Toydotgam." Each syllable in my name had its own meaning:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>"Toy":</b> From the English verb "toy," as in "to play [with something]."</li>
				<li><b>"dot":</b> This was the direct reference to Logdotzip. I just copied over the middle syllable.</li>
				<li><b>"gam(e)":</b> Just the word "game," as in a video game. The final E could be added or removed, either giving you the shortened "Toydotgam" display name, or the handle "Toydotgame," as I mentioned earlier.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The focus I had on "toy" as in "to play" and "game" as in "video game" was because I wanted to be a gaming YouTuber, as did most people in my demographic at the time. Yeah I was the 99%. Yeah I was cringe.</p>
			<br>
			<p>It's honestly not a super advanced, complicated, or creative name <i>at all</i>. It was unique and didn't have numbers though, which is all I really wanted.</p>
			<p>In 2021, I felt the name beginning to age. Seeing "Toydotgam" on everything I posted just felt wrong. The name started to feel cheap and boring to me, but I didn't want to change it – given how I had spread it over my entire online presence. My solution? Decapitalise the T and add that missing E to the end. That was it. Having a lowercase name is pretty kitschy (I knew that even then), but honestly, "Toydotgam" felt <b>so</b> cheap to me that kitschy capitalisation was worth it by far. The added E was just to further distance myself from Logdotzip. I seriously hadn't watched him since a few months after I came up with the name, so I had no real reason or want to keep the nine-letter three-syllable name.</p>
			<br>
			<p>So that's where we are today. I don't want to change my name anytime soon, especially given the monumental task it was to change my name just from "Toydotgam" to "toydotgame" (RIP SpigotMC and a few other accounts, you will be missed).So I'm staying as toydotgame for everything. Having an old name that you use everywhere is really nice. It makes things so much more convenient, and at the least, nice to look at.</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Edit </b>(Aug 12 2023)<b>:</b> As of nine days ago, I have had my name stylised as "toydotgame" longer than I have had it as "Toydotgam," at least according to NameMC. I had the old styling for at least 2.3 years; technically I've had Toydotgam since 2017 but it's been very infrequently used. Maybe my Scratch account for Toydotgam has a more accurate date – that one being Toydotgam for a longer period of time than I've had toydotgame now. IIRC my Discord account was the first one to be renamed from Toydotgam to toydotgame.</p>
