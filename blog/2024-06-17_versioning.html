			<h1>toy's Standardised Versioning</h1>
			<h2 id="subtitle">Written: <b>2024-06-17</b> &centerdot; Last Updated: <b>Never</b></h2>
			<p>After seven years or so of releasing software, I felt it was time to address a common problem in my personal programming style: the lack of a consistent versioning standard.</p>
			<p>The most common standard for a single versioning system is <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>. Overall, it's pretty good, but it has one main drawback: it is designed exclusively for APIs. I'm a desktop dev at heart, and my stuff doesn't have dependent software packages. So, for years, I've been ad-libbing my versioning system from project to project; every time I switched between projects I'd need to check the convention I had set in place before, which quickly gets annoying.</p>
			<p>I have a couple goals for my new standard:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Be stricter and more concise than SemVer:</b> SemVer has strings that get appended to version numbers like <code>-alpha+001</code>.<a class="cite" href="#1">1</a> I want to limit the number of characters in general use and over-simplify version strings, whilst still maintaining the possibility to represent things like preview releases and alphas and betas.</li>
				<li><b>Establish a strict and consistent standard for myself:</b> I want something with a clear and concise reference that not only I, but anyone else can cite in their own projects as a concrete system to use..</li>
			</ol>
			<p>…And so, I present you with:</p>
			<h2 style="text-align:center">toy's Standardised Versioning v1.0</h2>
			<small style="display:block; text-align:center">(Working Title)</small>
			<p style="text-align:center"><b>Format:</b> <code>&lt;channel&gt;&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;[.&lt;patch&gt;][hotfix|rc]</code></p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b><code>&lt;channel&gt;</code>:</b> By "channel," I'm referring to whether your software is in alpha, beta, or is the full production release.
					<ul>
						<li><b>Alpha (<code>a</code>)</b> is the unstable version of your software, when you're still working on adding all the features.</li>
						<li><b>Beta (<code>b</code>)</b> is when all functionality is there, and bug-fixing/testing takes place. Some small final tweaks to functionality get made.</li>
						<li><b>Release (<code>v</code>)</b> is the production copy of your software.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b><code>&lt;major&gt;</code>:</b> The major version is ≥1 (never 0), and increments when you do refactoring that changes the underlying algorithms behind your program's functionality. It is also for <b>breaking changes</b>, such as dropping an old config file format without providing automatic migration to the new format in your code.</li>
				<li><b><code>&lt;minor&gt;</code>:</b> The minor version starts at 0 when the major version increments, and increments when you release batches of new features and bugfixes ("feature updates"). A minor update <b>cannot</b> be bugfix-only.</li>
				<li><b><code>[patch]</code>:</b> The patch number starts at 0 for every minor increment, and increments when you release bugfixes consolidated into one rollup patch update. They <i>ideally</i> shouldn't change functionality at all.</li>
				<li>
					The final part of the version is two mutually exclusive options:
					<ul>
						<li><b><code>[hotfix]</code>:</b> A hotfix is a small <b>bugfix-only</b> update that contains fixes for <b>critical</b> bugs in the latest release of your production software. The hotfix number is padded with zeroes to be two digits long and is appended to the latest version with an underscore, <i>e.g:</i> <code>_01</code>.</li>
						<li><b><code>[rc]</code>:</b> Release candidates are for the <i>release</i> channel of your software <b>only</b>, and should not have hotfix updates shipped for them—as the user knowingly accepts that a release candidate version is inherently an unstable preview version. The number for RCs starts at 1 and increments indefinitely until the production release arrives. <i>e.g:</i> The first beta build of <code>v1.2</code>, based on <code>v1.1</code>'s codebase, is <code>v1.2-rc1</code>. Whilst you're releasing RC pre-releases, you can still update your production releases:

						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<h3>Example Valid Version Numbers</h3>
			<p><code>a1.0</code> → <code>a1.1</code> → <code>b1.0</code> → <code>b1.0.1</code> → <code>v1.0</code> → <code>v1.1</code> → <code>v1.1_01</code> → <code>v1.2-rc1</code> and <code>v1.1.1</code> (based on the same prior release) → <code>v1.2</code></p>
