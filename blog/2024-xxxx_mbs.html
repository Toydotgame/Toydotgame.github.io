			<h1>The Tale of Minecraft's Baddest Server</h1>
			<h2 id="subtitle">Written: <b>yyyy-mm-dd</b> &centerdot; Last Updated: <b>Never</b></h2>
			<p>This is a tale I've wanted to tell for a long, long time. A proper full documented history of a server otherwise lost to time and only known to the very few who played it: <b>Minecraft's Baddest Server</b> (MBS).</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Okay so is there context?</h2>
			<p>This is a pretty niche topic, but I'm writing it half as a tribute to the server and half as a reference for the last few remaining players (including myself) who still hold a fond memory of a place that no longer exists. If you're not a former player, then there's not much here that you'd be personally that invested in; but read on if you're a fan of a good ol' chronology because <i>boy can I write one of those!</i></p>
			<br>
			<p>So as a quick overview of what the hell MBS is and why <i>I</i> have any involvement is this:</p>
			<p><b>Minecraft's Baddest Server</b> (MBS), later <b>SeveriaMC</b> (SMC) was a small Minecraft SMP server established in 2020 by a small group of people who rose from the ashes of another community on a different server. Most notably, MBS was a <i>silver age</i> Minecraft server. <i>Silver age</i> comes as a spin off of the concept of <b>Golden Age Minecraft</b> (y'know, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldenAgeMinecraft/">the subreddit</a>): those Golden Years of early Minecraft from Classic to Release 1.2.5 (although some will argue of Beta 1.9's suckiness, therefore leaving Beta 1.8.9 as the last good version). <i>Silver age</i> refers to the period just after that: 1.3 through to the last ever non-Microsoft release, Release 1.8.9</p>
			<p>Beta 1.9 (what became Release 1.0) was a heavily controversial update that added hunger and sprinting, just to name a bit. There was a good proportion of the playerbase who were so opposed to such changes that they chose to simply not play the newer version. These people stuck to what was a recent version when their grievances were new, and nowâ€”13 years later (wow!)â€”keep going with a once-new-now-antique version. Others, however, haven't played Minecraft since 2011 or before, and just admire the simplicity of Beta Minecraft. Either or, the number of people in the Golden Age Minecraft community is large. (Remember: Minecraft's first explosion of popularity online (back in ye olde Yogscast days) was in 2011, during midâ€“late Beta) I myself am in the Silver Age camp: I started playing Minecraft the day after 1.5 released, so the first few post-1.0 releases of the game are my personal favouritesâ€”ones I remember the best and hold in the highest regard, despite having played versions from every era spanning from Pre-Classic to 1.20 being the latest.</p>
			<img class="fright" src="/media/blog/2024-xxxx_mbs-poster.png" width="35%" />
			<p>So in 2020, I see a server ad while scrolling recent posts on Reddit one evening (inset right is a similar poster, I believe the original (<a href="https://i.redd.it/p3k7if2jun751.png">at this dead link</a>) is lost to time).<a class="cite" href="#1">1</a> It's for a Release 1.0 SMP with the grammatically questionable-sounding name of "Minecraft's Baddest Server"â€”with a release date, launching soonâ€”and it has a Discord invite. I save the post for later, and when later comes, I join the Discord and have a look around to see what it's all about. There aren't too many people around, as it's about a week and a bit out from launch; nevertheless, I join in with the server and prepare for launch day.</p>
			<h2 class="freset">A Full History</h2>
			<p><i>Okay, well to tell this story we'll have to go back. Way back.</i> <small>I swear we actually need to.</small></p>
			<p>In 2014, and then again in 2017, a public Beta 1.7.3 golden age Minecraft server called <b>RetroMC</b> is founded.<a class="cite" href="#2">2</a> RetroMC is a Towny SMP, meaning that most players are divided into town groups where they build and build a community. One such community is the town <b>Neoncity</b>, lead by an unnamed owner. The Neoncity group has its own Discord and a decently sized community on the RetroMC server.</p>
			<p>However, the leader of Neoncity destroys the Discord server and disbands the town on RetroMC (leaving the physical builds untouched). Most members of the town give up on the server, leaving very few remaining former Neoncity players. Somewhere between June and September 2019, the remaining Neoncity players form their own private SMP amongst each other. This SMP lasts until sometime in earlyâ€“mid 2020, where player counts drop off and interest is eventually lost, and the server eventually closes.</p>
			<br>
			<p>On June 28<sup>th</sup>, 2020, a former Neoncity SMP member by the name of Calx makes a post on the /r/GoldenAgeMinecraft subreddit advertising a new SMP on a post titled "<i>Minecraft's baddest Server</i>."<a class="cite" href="#1">1</a> This is the same ad I would see one evening scrolling Reddit (a pastime I thankfully have not partaken in for years ðŸ˜Œ) The advertisement stated that MBS would be a Release 1.0 Minecraft server, and that it would launch on the 8<sup>th</sup> of Julyâ€”1 week and 3 days after posting. Comments vary from:<a class="cite" href="#1">1</a></p>
			<blockquote>i know this is not before 1.0, but i'd consider it part of old mc.</blockquote>
			<p>and</p>
			<blockquote>This is dope</blockquote>
			<p>â€¦to:</p>
			<blockquote>read rule 1</blockquote>
			<small>(Outright dismissal of the post because /r/GoldenAgeMinecraft prefers Beta 1.8 and before)</small>
			<p>Regardless, Neoncity stragglers and their friends meet new players, including me, in the following days after the post goes up. Overall, the singular post brings in a relatively large amount of activity to the Discord pending the server's launch. Calx said in December of 2023:</p>
			<blockquote>as far as i remember people only began joining after we put the reddit banner up</blockquote>
			<p>I remember as the server picked up, quite a few messages and conversations passing each day getting ready for the full server to release. Finally, the day comes. I miss a lot of the very initial Getting Wood moments of the server, but I'm there by day one to explore and fill out my inventory just a bit. Here's the first photo I take:</p>
			<img src="/media/blog/2024-xxxx_first-screenshot.png" />
			<p><i>Did I mention I was doing this all on my Inspiron 1545?</i> 3 GiB RAM and a Pentium T4400. Not great. That thing was 10/11 years old <i>then</i>, and wasn't getting any faster with a bodged copy of Release 1.0 and no OptiFine to speak of. Anyway, I digress.</p>
			<p>The first few days of the server are very nice, everyone heads out and builds communities and works together to create pretty great things. It seems that each time I log back on the place where I had logged off had developed into an even more polished and completed town area. Potentially the single earliest town established was named <b>Minecraft's Baddest Town</b>:</p>

			<p>This place went from a crop, a bed, and a chest, to multiple player houses, mines, farms, and plain decorative builds within a matter of days right at the start of the server. I was around to see it spring to life in real time.</p>
