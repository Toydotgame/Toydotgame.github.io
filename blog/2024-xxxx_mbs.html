			<h1>The Tale of Minecraft's Baddest Server</h1>
			<h2 id="subtitle">Written: <b>yyyy-mm-dd</b> &centerdot; Last Updated: <b>Never</b></h2>
			<p>This is a tale I've wanted to tell for a long, long time. A proper full documented history of a server otherwise lost to time and only known to the very few who played it: <b>Minecraft's Baddest Server</b> (MBS).</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Okay so is there context?</h2>
			<p>This is a pretty niche topic, but I'm writing it half as a tribute to the server and half as a reference for the last few remaining players (including myself) who still hold a fond memory of a place that no longer exists. If you're not a former player, then there's not much here that you'd be personally that invested in; but read on if you're a fan of a good ol' chronology because <i>boy can I write one of those!</i></p>
			<br>
			<p>So as a quick overview of what the hell MBS is and why <i>I</i> have any involvement is this:</p>
			<p><b>Minecraft's Baddest Server</b> (MBS), later <b>SeveriaMC</b> (SMC) was a small Minecraft SMP server established in 2020 by a small group of people who rose from the ashes of another community on a different server. Most notably, MBS was a <i>silver age</i> Minecraft server. <i>Silver age</i> comes as a spin off of the concept of <b>Golden Age Minecraft</b> (y'know, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldenAgeMinecraft/">the subreddit</a>): those Golden Years of early Minecraft from Classic to Release 1.2.5 (although some will argue of Beta 1.9's suckiness, therefore leaving Beta 1.8.9 as the last good version). <i>Silver age</i> refers to the period just after that: 1.3 through to the last ever non-Microsoft release, Release 1.8.9</p>
			<p>Beta 1.9 (what became Release 1.0) was a heavily controversial update that added hunger and sprinting, just to name a bit. There was a good proportion of the playerbase who were so opposed to such changes that they chose to simply not play the newer version. These people stuck to what was a recent version when their grievances were new, and now—13 years later (wow!)—keep going with a once-new-now-antique version. Others, however, haven't played Minecraft since 2011 or before, and just admire the simplicity of Beta Minecraft. Either or, the number of people in the Golden Age Minecraft community is large. (Remember: Minecraft's first explosion of popularity online (back in ye olde Yogscast days) was in 2011, during mid–late Beta) I myself am in the Silver Age camp: I started playing Minecraft the day after 1.5 released, so the first few post-1.0 releases of the game are my personal favourites—ones I remember the best and hold in the highest regard, despite having played versions from every era spanning from Pre-Classic to 1.20 being the latest.</p>
			<img class="fright" src="/media/blog/2024-xxxx_mbs-poster.png" width="35%" />
			<p>So in 2020, I see a server ad while scrolling recent posts on Reddit one evening (inset right is a similar poster, I believe the original (<a href="https://i.redd.it/p3k7if2jun751.png">at this dead link</a>) is lost to time).<a class="cite" href="#1">1</a> It's for a Release 1.0 SMP with the grammatically questionable-sounding name of "Minecraft's Baddest Server"—with a release date, launching soon—and it has a Discord invite. I save the post for later, and when later comes, I join the Discord and have a look around to see what it's all about. There aren't too many people around, as it's about 1–2 weeks out from launch; nevertheless, I join in with the server and prepare for launch day.</p>
