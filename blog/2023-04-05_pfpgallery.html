			<h1>A Gallery of all my Profile Pictures</h1>
			<h2 id="subtitle">Written: <b>2023-04-05</b> &centerdot; Last Updated: <b>2023-08-14</b></h2>
			<p>I've had a few profile pictures over the years. I have no idea if or what I had on my older accounts, but since 2017, most things are relatively well-documented.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Ravenclaw (2017)</h3>
			<img class="fleft" width="30%" src="/media/blog/2023-04-05_pfpravenclaw.png" />
			<p>Not much to say about this one. I was a fan of the Harry Potter books (I have since discovered <i>far</i> better literature, trust me), and I just downloaded a generic resource folder from Pottermore after doing one of those house sorting tests. It's the oldest file I have categorised in my profile picture resource folder, and once served as my profile picture on both of my Scratch accounts at the time. Currently, the only remaining account with this profile picture is Minecraft-Game on Scratch.</p>
			<h3>Toydotgam Diamond (2018 – 2019)</h3>
			<img class="fleft" width="30%" src="/media/blog/2023-04-05_pfptoydotdiamond.jpg" />
			<p>This image is from a site called Novaskin, where you upload a Minecraft skin image file and it creates a 3D model that you can use in a lot of predefined scenes to create images with your own Minecraft skin in it. I thought it was super cool at the time, and also I wanted a unique-to-me profile picture to replace the generic one(s) I had had before, so I chose one I liked and went with it. Sometime in late 2019, I saw a FitMC video on YouTube where the same Novaskin template was used in the thumbnail with Fit's own skin, and realised that my profile picture still wasn't unique enough. I had been using Discord for about six months around this time as well, and I was getting bored of chatting and seeing my profile picture and its bland colours in the chat.</p>
			<h3>Presentation1 (2019 – 2020, 2020 – 2021)</h3>
			<img class="fleft" width="30%" src="/media/blog/2023-04-05_pfppresentation1.jpg" />
			<p>Despite wanting more uniqueness, this profile picture's base was still created in Novaskin. <i>But you know what else had happened between 2018 and 2019?</i> PewDiePie vs. T-Series. 2019 was the one exclusive year I watched PewDiePie, and when I say "watched," I mean I watched him almost exclusively for many months on end. I was the peak cringe 9-year-old (also very active on /r/PewDiePie submissions). So, similar to how my name comes from Logdotzip, Presentation1 came from PewDiePie. My reference to him is the very obvious PewDiePie red wavy pattern in the centre covering the "face" part of my profile picture. But, I was still a Minecraft fan at heart, so I overlayed a semi-transparent Grass Block texture over it. I still like this profile picture; it's been my longest-lasting profile picture, spanning over three years.</p>
			<p>But why the name? <i>Presentation1?</i> I'll tell you why: I made it in PowerPoint. Presentation1 is the default PowerPoint presentation name. I still have the <code>Presentation1.pptx</code> file on my computer today. It's a single slide, 1,000px × 1,000px in size. The center piece over the face is just the wavy thing cropped to a square with a 6pt border, and a Grass Block of the same size overlayed at 50% opacity or whatever. It turned out alright for something made in PowerPoint.</p>
			<p>This profile picture is still in place on my "Toydotgam" account on Scratch. I'd make a guess that maybe one or two of my other accounts still have it, just because I had it for such a long time – but honestly, I'm not positive; I think it only survives on Scratch.</p>
			<h3>Picrew (2020)</h3>
			<img class="fleft" width="30%" src="/media/blog/2023-04-05_pfppicrew.png" />
			<p>In late 2019, I came out as bi; a lot of people I know came out around that time. And as the stereotype goes, everyone with <a href="https://picrew.me/ja/secret_image_maker/GWQo0ayzr7bd5eKF" title="Sangled Character Creator on Picrew">one of those Sangled Picrews</a> was a member of the LGBT community. I wanted in on being a stereotypical LGBT person lmao, so I made one too. When I say everyone I knew had one, I mean it. In 2020, 9 out of 10 people I talked on Discord that I knew had one of these. They eventually died out in my circles, with the final one linked to that era being changed only this year (2023).</p>
			<img class="fright" width="40%" src="/media/blog/2023-04-05_picrewgh.png" />
			<p>As a bonus, here's a couple screenshots I found from 2020 with the profile picture, one of my GitHub account page (pre- light theme days, lol) and another of the exact moment I changed my profile picture on Discord:</p>
			<img class="fleft" width="30%" src="/media/blog/2023-04-05_omguwentanime.png" />
			<p>It was fun while it lasted. Eventually I got bored of it and changed it back to Presentation1 after a couple months of having it.</p><br>
			<h3>Voxellate (2021)</h3>
			<img class="fleft" width="30%" src="/media/blog/2023-04-05_pfpvoxellate.png" />
			<p>Eventually, I grew bored of Presentation1. I also wanted to move on from PewDiePie, as I was slowly coming to realise that I was, in fact, cringe. Around this time I had found the GitHub account of someone I once knew, by the name of <i><a href="https://github.com/Voxellate/">Voxellate</a></i>. Being around the time I was considering a new profile picture, I really liked what he had: just a simple, monotone, pixel-art-y style profile picture that really stood out. So I took my current Minecraft skin's face, as the pixel art part, and gave it a white background to inset it (also making a variant with extra padding for circular profile picture sites), then I made an overlay of a saturated tint of <code>#964594</code>, the hex for the purple part of the bisexual pride flag. At the time, I really liked what I had made. This profile picture survives on my SevenForums, TenForums, and I think maybe my SpigotMC account too?</p>
			<h3>Voxellate F (2022)</h3>
			<img class="fleft" width="30%" src="/media/blog/2023-04-05_pfpvoxellatef.png" />
			<p><a href="https://namemc.com/skin/66f58e66b1c20aa3" title="NameMC - toydotgame Minecraft Skin">I updated my Minecraft skin in 2022</a>, and so I kind of had to update my profile picture. The only real difference between my "Voxellate" avatar and Voxellate F is [obviously] the skin, but also that it had two layers on the skin, so I had to overlay the "helmet" layer of the skin over the normal "head" layer, and of course probably the more obvious fact that I removed the saturation of the bi pride flag purple. At the time of applying it, I thought my new profile picture looked super grey and desaturated, but looking at it now, my old one just seems really over-saturated.</p>
			<small>A bit of context for the skin change: I had been questioning my gender since late 2021, and I updated my skin to be a bit more feminine after a few months. In March of 2023, I came out as genderfluid. I guess that solves that lmao.</small>
			<p>I don't plan on changing this profile picture any time soon, but in the last few months as of writing, I have been more and more a part of the furry community (make of that what you will, I don't really care at this point), so I might replace it with a sona design once I can get GIMP working for digital art lol. If I make a proper sona, I'd probably update my Minecraft skin as well, but I don't plan on making my next profile picture a Minecraft-skin-based one – the profile picture I have will probably just be the straight-up sona design and not the Minecraft version of it.</p>
			<h3>4Tech (2023)</h3>
			<img class="fleft" width="30%" src="/media/blog/2023-04-05_pfp4tech.png" />
			<p><b>Update </b>(2023-08-14)<b>:</b> <a href="https://namemc.com/skin/b22cbb133dd1bf77" title="NameMC - toydotgame Minecraft Skin">Oops! All furries!</a> I updated my Minecraft skin and so thus the trend continues. The skin is named "4Tech" in honour of the player I took the most inspiration from when making the source skin – 4TechM. This skin is my fursona, Nitrogen. Maybe I'll write about them the one day I decide to be that mundane.</p>
