			<h1>Site v5</h1>
			<h2 id="subtitle">Written: <b>2023-12-16</b> &centerdot; Last Updated: <b>Never</b></h2>
			<p>Oops I did it again.</p>
			<p>Today's site rendition inspired by <a href="https://maia.crimew.gay/">maia's site</a> and also <a href="https://versary.town/">versary.town</a> (<a href="http://http://www.themostamazingwebsiteontheinternet.com/">www.themostamazingwebsiteontheinternet.com</a> you better watch out man…). The main reason I did this is because Site v4 had god awful CSS where most things were set based on a million <code>calc()</code>s and most measurements were based on <code>var(--padding)</code>, which itself was measured in <code>vh</code>. It was, <b>a mess</b>.</p>
			<p>Not only that, but the webpage design wasn't responsive in the slightest. (Did I mention slow on other platforms given the heavy use of CSS <code>calc()</code>?) I had a hodge-podge design based mainly around <code>display:none</code>s to hide elements and show elements depending on viewport orientation??? Yeah it was pretty bad.</p>
			<p>Site v4, you will go down in infamy as the shortest-lived site design (<a href="/blog/2023-04-04_sitev4">yet somehow not beating Site v1??</a>) – but definitely far from the worst.</p>
			<p>New features of this site are not only a more responsive design, but a stylesheet that is built properly and didn't break <i>nearly</i> as many times as the last one did during development.</p>
			<p>My main new feature though, is the badges: now at the bottom of <u>every</u> page! And a hits counter! Shoutout to the 88 X 31 site for having a gazillion badges to choose from, they're fun. The badges, header, footer, and recent blog articles are all loaded using a JS file, making it <i>way</i> easier to update things across all pages, and <i>way</i> less janky than my <code>iframe</code> solutions of websites past.</p>
