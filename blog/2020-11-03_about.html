			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<h2 id="subtitle">Written: <b>2020-11-03</b> &centerdot; Last Updated: <b>2022-09-07</b></h2>
			<h2>What I Do</h2>
			<p>Not much. I play Minecraft and occasionally some of the Half-Life games, and I code <em>when I can actually come up with ideas</em>.</p>
			<p>This site is mostly dedicated to my code-related doings, however.</p>
			<h2>What I've Done in the Past</h2>
			<h3>2016</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Minecraft-Game/">A pretty awful Scratch account.</a> This is how I discovered software development. Yep.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>2017</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Toydotgam/">More Scratch.</a></li>
				<li>Around this time, I got in to Windows (around build 1709 if you're interested) and computer hardware.</li>
				<li>I made my first website, and trust me, it looked like it was straight out of the '90s. No, you can't see it.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>2018</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Nothing much, more Scratch, and more static web dev.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>2019</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>In 2019, I started distro hopping, from Kubuntu, to Ubuntu, to Majaro, back to Ubuntu, and then I found Arch…</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>2020</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>In 2020, I got a Dell Inspiron 1545 (from like 2009 or 2010 or something) with 3 GBs of RAM and an awful CPU. This was also my first personal computer that only I used.</li>
				<li>In February, I started my Minecraft server, <a href="https://iccmc.serveminecraft.net">ICCMC</a>. It started out being hosted on my "new" laptop, but as of early 2021 it has its own dedicated PC (an old Lenovo ThinkCentre).</li>
				<li>From early-mid-2020, I started learning Java.</li>
				<li>This website was launched sometime in the middle of the year.</li>
				<li>In November, I may or may not have accidentally wiped the parition table of my hard drive. I bought an SSD to replace it, which was a blessing on such an old laptop; and, as I was without any data and had nothing to lose, I might as well try Arch, right? Yeah, I still use Arch to this day and I'm never going back. So long, Windows 7.</li>
				<li>In December I wrote the concept and base code for my first major Java project that I intended to support for a long time, Thisway. I still support and develop that plugin to this day.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>2021</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>I upgraded my crappy laptop to its max specs, 8 GBs of RAM, the aforementioned SSD, and a decent Core 2 Duo.</li>
				<li>In July I rewrote my personal website to what it is today.</li>
				<li>In October, I started <a href="https://github.com/toydotgame/old-google">my first ever browser extension</a>! It's a Firefox addon that achieved the fairly simple goal of changing the Google logo on google.com. Like Thisway, I still plan, and <em>do</em>, support this addon to this day.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>2022</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>I built a new PC. <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/b/PTskcf">Specs here.</a> It's a massive upgrade from what I came from.</li>
				<li>I moved the ICCMC server from the Lenovo ThinkCentre (which now only hosts the website) to an old HTPC box from circa 2010.</li>
			</ul>
